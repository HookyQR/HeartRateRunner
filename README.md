# Heart Pace Runner

![HeartRateRunner Screenshot Bright](/doc/cover.png) 

All running metrics on a single screen based on a [design concept](https://www.behance.net/gallery/35894907/Running-metrics-on-a-single-screen-no-distraction)

Being tested so far. Please tell me if it runs for you on a different device than Garmin fenix 3
When I try to use custom fonts it runs out of memory. I am open for suggestions. With device fonts it looks like this:

DataField designed to show all running metrics at one page. 
It shows heart rate and lap pace with trends and hr zones. 

* Current heart rate zone indicator (zones from a watch profile)
* Heart rate trend for up to 30 mins
* Average pace trend chart for last 5 laps and current lap average
* Pace difference indicator of how the current pace differs from the lap average
* Shows km or mi based on system settings
* Distance elapsed distance in km or miles based on system settings.
* Duration of the activity in [hh:]mm:ss
* use bright or dark color scheme based on the background color setting of the app (Settings/Apps/Run/Background Color).
  needs at least a firmware with SDK 1.2 compatibility (otherwise bright scheme is always used).
